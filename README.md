# video_eyeTracking_ECoG

1. Make a new Python environment with set version and additional packages
```buildoutcfg
conda create -n "eyedetect" python=3.11.4 ffmpeg tqdm dlib
```
Activate new environment called "eyedetect"
```buildoutcfg
conda activate eyedetect
```

2. Install a couple other packages with pip
```buildoutcfg
pip install opencv-python
```
```buildoutcfg
pip install --upgrade mediapipe
```
```buildoutcfg
brew install wget
```


## CSV Column Descriptions

The CSV files generated by the gaze-tracking script include several columns that capture both the raw eye gaze directions and the gaze directions adjusted for head position. Below is a description of each column to help you understand the data:

1. **Frame Number**
   - **Description**: The index of the frame in the video, starting from 1.
   - **Units**: None (integer).

2. **Timestamp (ms)**
   - **Description**: The timestamp corresponding to each frame, measured in milliseconds from the start of the video.
   - **Units**: Milliseconds.

3. **Head-Adjusted Left Eye Gaze X (degrees)**
   - **Description**: The horizontal direction of the left eye's gaze, adjusted for the head's yaw (horizontal rotation). This provides a more accurate representation of where the left eye is looking in the environment.
   - **Units**: Degrees.

4. **Head-Adjusted Left Eye Gaze Y (degrees)**
   - **Description**: The vertical direction of the left eye's gaze, adjusted for the head's pitch (vertical tilt). This provides a more accurate representation of where the left eye is looking in the environment.
   - **Units**: Degrees.

5. **Head-Adjusted Right Eye Gaze X (degrees)**
   - **Description**: The horizontal direction of the right eye's gaze, adjusted for the head's yaw (horizontal rotation). This provides a more accurate representation of where the right eye is looking in the environment.
   - **Units**: Degrees.

6. **Head-Adjusted Right Eye Gaze Y (degrees)**
   - **Description**: The vertical direction of the right eye's gaze, adjusted for the head's pitch (vertical tilt). This provides a more accurate representation of where the right eye is looking in the environment.
   - **Units**: Degrees.

7. **Raw Left Eye Gaze X (pixels)**
   - **Description**: The horizontal direction of the left eye's gaze in pixel space, measured relative to the outer corner of the left eye. This does not account for the head's position.
   - **Units**: Pixels.

8. **Raw Left Eye Gaze Y (pixels)**
   - **Description**: The vertical direction of the left eye's gaze in pixel space, measured relative to the outer corner of the left eye. This does not account for the head's position.
   - **Units**: Pixels.

9. **Raw Right Eye Gaze X (pixels)**
   - **Description**: The horizontal direction of the right eye's gaze in pixel space, measured relative to the outer corner of the right eye. This does not account for the head's position.
   - **Units**: Pixels.

10. **Raw Right Eye Gaze Y (pixels)**
    - **Description**: The vertical direction of the right eye's gaze in pixel space, measured relative to the outer corner of the right eye. This does not account for the head's position.
    - **Units**: Pixels.
